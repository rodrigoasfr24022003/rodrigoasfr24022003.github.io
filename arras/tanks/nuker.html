                        <p>It has a team-colored circular body with a bigger <span class="gray">gray</span> Missiler barrel inscribed with a radiation symbol.</p>
                        <p>Said missiles look like real missiles, having their body with a 4x2 rectangle of square segments and a large triangular segment, as well as 2 fins, all team-colored and three <span class="gray">gray</span> rocket engines in the back.</p>

                        <p>Shoots initially slow and slow-turning missiles that home in on enemies for the first 2.5s of their lifespan, then these missiles accelerate massively and cease to be homing. It has a snail-like reload of 12s. Said missiles deal overkill direct damage and deal slightly overkill splash damage in a large radius.</p>
