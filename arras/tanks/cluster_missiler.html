                    <p>The <b>Cluster Missiler</b> is a tank that shoots fast but fragile missiles that burn enemies and split on death. It upgrades from <a href="./missiler.html"></a>, <a href="./frags/frag_8.html" class="redlink">Frag-(8)</a> and <a href="https://woomyarrasio.fandom.com/wiki/Torch:_T4">Torch</a> at level 60.</p>

                        <p>It has a team-colored circular body with a <span class="gray">gray</span> Missiler barrel and has a long <a href="./ap_basic.html">AP-Basic</a> Barrel-shaped <span class="orange">orange</span> prop with a inscribed rune that means "8".</p>
                        <p>Said missiles look like real missiles, having their body with 4 square segments and a triangular segment, as well as 2 fins, all team-colored and a <span class="gray">gray</span> rocket engine in the back.</p>

                        <p>Shoots very fast homing missiles that can be shot down with a single <a href="https://woomyarrasio.fandom.com/wiki/Basic">Basic</a> bullet. It has a very slow reload of 5s. Said missiles deal considerable direct damage and deal low splash damage and splash <span class="torch">Torch</span> for 3s in a medium radius.</p>
                        <p>Said missiles split 8 of <a href="./swarm_missiler.html">Swarm Missiler</a>'s missiles, but their splash also inflicts <span class="torch">Torch</span> for 1s.</p>
