                        <p>It has a team-colored circular body with a <span class="gray">gray</span> Missiler Barrel and 2 squares with trapezoidal thrusters on the front side, connected to the middle of the tank body by more rectangles, all of them <span class="gray">gray</span>.</p>
                        <p>Said missiles look like real missiles, having their body with 4 square segments and a triangular segment, as well as 2 fins, all team-colored and a <span class="gray">gray</span> rocket engine in the back.</p>

                        <p>Similar to Missiler, except that it can enter kite mode on right-click, where it deals 20% less body damage, but has a lot of speed. Right-click again to leave kite mode.</p>
